  This is a "Solution Style" tsconfig.json file, and is used by editors and TypeScriptâ€™s language server to improve development experience.
  It is not intended to be used to perform a compilation.

  To learn more about this file see: https://angular.io/config/solution-tsconfig.

  
  NOTE: RKS there was a reference to e2e folder (containing some jasmin config which I deleted -
  hopefully wasn't required)
